File Modes in Python
Where the following modes of operation are supported:

r: open an existing file for reading.
w: opens an existing file for writing. If the file already has data in it, it will be overwritten.
a: open an existing file for appending. It will not override any existing data.
r+: To read and write data into a file. Previous data in the file will not be erased.
w+: To write and read data. It will override any previously stored data.
a+: To append and read data from a file. It will not override any existing data.
The open command opens the file in read mode, and the for loop prints each line in the file through open file python.
